# SortAlgorithm
This project is an exercise in the sorting algorithm. 
I use the winform application written in C#.


There are 8 sorting exercises: Bubble, Select, Insert, Merge, Quick, Heap, Shell, and Radix.


The demo .exe file is at SortAlgorithm\SortAlgorithm\bin\Release.
You can download SortAlgorithm.exe and see the demo.


The algorithm is based on the "資料結構：使用Java" book written by 呂高旭. Some of these algorithms I have done some simple optimization based on personal understanding.

# SortAlgorithm
This project is an exercise in the sorting algorithm. 
I use the winform application written in C#.


There are 8 sorting exercises: Bubble, Select, Insert, Merge, Quick, Heap, Shell, and Radix.


The demo .exe file is at SortAlgorithm\SortAlgorithm\bin\Release.
You can download SortAlgorithm.exe and see the demo.
